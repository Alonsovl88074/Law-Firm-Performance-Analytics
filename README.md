# Law-Firm-Performance-Analytics
This project simulates a complete Business Intelligence (BI) solution for a personal injury law firm. As the BI Developer/Analyst, I designed and built an end-to-end analytics dashboard in Microsoft Power BI to provide the firm's leadership with a 360-degree view of their operations.

## üöÄ Project Summary

This repository documents the end-to-end creation of a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution for a fictional personal injury law firm. The project's goal was to move the firm from a state of scattered, raw data to a centralized, interactive analytics ecosystem.

As the sole BI Developer, I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle: from defining business requirements and preparing the data, through ETL, data modeling, DAX measure creation, and finally, designing a suite of four strategic dashboards in **Microsoft Power BI**. This project showcases a deep understanding of both the technical BI stack and the specific business drivers of a professional services firm.

## üéØ The Business Problem & Strategic Goals

The law firm's leadership faced a common but critical challenge: a lack of data-driven visibility into their operations. Their data was fragmented across various systems (case management software, accounting spreadsheets, marketing reports), making it impossible to answer fundamental strategic questions:

1.  **Financial Performance:** Which types of cases are truly the most profitable after accounting for expenses? Are certain attorneys consistently generating more revenue?
2.  **Operational Efficiency:** What is the average time it takes to resolve a case? Where are the bottlenecks in our case lifecycle? Is our attorney workload balanced?
3.  **Marketing Effectiveness:** What is our Return on Investment (ROI) for marketing campaigns? Which channels bring in the most valuable clients, not just the most leads?
4.  **Client Satisfaction:** How can we quantitatively measure client happiness? Is there a link between how we operate and how clients feel about our service?

The goal was to build a "single source of truth" to answer these questions and empower data-informed decision-making at every level of the firm.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Step-by-Step Development Process

I followed a structured BI development methodology, broken down into distinct, logical phases.

Phase 1: Data Sourcing & Preparation
To build a realistic prototype, I first defined the necessary data entities and then generated sample datasets. The data was structured to mirror what a real law firm would produce.
The following tables were created as CSV/Excel files:
Fact_Cases: The central transactional table containing one row per legal case, with all key metrics.
Dim_PracticeArea: A lookup table for case types (e.g., "Car Accident", "Medical Malpractice").
Dim_Attorney: A lookup table for attorneys and their seniority.
Dim_CaseStatus: Describes the stages of a case lifecycle (e.g., "Open", "Negotiation", "Settled").
Dim_LeadSource: A lookup table for marketing channels.
Dim_Client: A list of clients.
